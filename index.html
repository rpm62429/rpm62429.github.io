<h2>Is It A Cult?</h2>
<hr>
</div>
<p>Cults have long been a part of popular American Culture. Numerous commonly used phrases, such as "don't drink the kool-aid, bro!", originate from extremist cults which garnered massive media attention. However, while cults are prominent in the modern world, there is still no commonly agreed upon definition of what classifies groups as cults. This inconsistency leads to an inability to properly classify active religious groups/organizations as cults, thereby enabling organizations which teeter the line to continue to persist, recruit, and expand unaffected. While this is done by many organizations worldwide, none is more infamous than the Church of Scientology.</p>

<p>This <s>cult</s> religion, founded by L. Ron Hubbard, actually began as a "field of science" researching a concept Hubard fabricated named "Dianetics". This field was oriented around removing the negative impact of traumatic events in an individual's life through a process known as "auditing". During the auditing process, a person would openly discuss the past event with a therapist in an attempt to come to terms with the trauma. This method of psychotherapy was largely discredited by the medical community. </p>

<p>Auditing became the center of Scientology, and morphed into a way to remove the "engrams", or restless spirits, that were present inside each person. However, the process changed and incorporated new equipment. A machine called an E-meter was introduced as a way to measure if the memories being revealed by the individual were enough to remove the trauma. This machine was functionally useless, but the person operating the machine could mislead the patient to continue to divulge information. This information was kept by the church, and later used as blackmail if the member faltered in their Faith.</p>

<p>This is a very broad look at Scientology, missing many key aspects of the religion. If you wish to look into it further, please reference their <a href="https:www.scientology.org">website</a>. However, below is a table which compares organizations widely viewed as cults in popular culture with Scientology. A list of common cult traits is also provided for personal research. The similarities are staggering, and certainly show worrying and tell-tale signs of cult behavior. </p>
<ol>
<li>Charasmatic (and typically traumatized) Founders and Leaders</li>
<li>Borrowed Mainstream Religious Concepts</li>
<li>Impending Doom/End of World Revelations</li>
<li>Dedication of Assets and Personal Self, typically to Death</li>
